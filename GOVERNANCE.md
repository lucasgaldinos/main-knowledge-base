# AI Knowledge Base Governance Framework

## Academic Research Standards

### Research Lifecycle Management

#### Knowledge States

- **draft**: Work in progress, not ready for review
- **in-review**: Under peer review or validation
- **published**: Validated and ready for use
- **deprecated**: Outdated but preserved for reference
- **archived**: Historical content moved to archives

#### Quality Assurance

- All content requires YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Academic sources must be cited using standard formats
- External validation required for technical claims
- Peer review process for significant updates

### Database Integration Standards

#### SQLite Database Usage

- **Knowledge Base**: `/database/knowledge.db` - Research findings, citations
- **Tool Analytics**: `/database/analytics.db` - Tool usage patterns, performance
- **Citation Database**: `/database/citations.db` - Academic references, bibliographic data
- **Workflow Tracking**: `/database/workflows.db` - Research process documentation

#### Database Schema Requirements

- Foreign key constraints enforced
- Metadata tracking for all entries
- Version control integration
- Automated backup procedures

### Content Organization Principles

#### Directory Structure Governance

- **knowledge/**: Core academic content with rigorous validation
- **projects/**: Active research projects with lifecycle tracking
- **resources/**: Reference materials and tools with metadata
- **infrastructure/**: Technical configuration and automation
- **outputs/**: Generated content and publications

#### File Naming Conventions

- Lowercase, hyphen-separated: `research-methodology.md`
- Date prefixes for temporal content: `2025-09-10-findings.md`
- Version suffixes for iterations: `analysis-v2.md`
- Consistent extensions: `.md` for documentation, `.py` for scripts

### YAML Frontmatter Requirements

#### Mandatory Fields

```yaml
---
title: [Descriptive title]
description: [Brief summary]
status: [draft|in-review|published|deprecated|archived]
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
tags: [relevant, keywords]
---
```

#### Academic Content Extensions

```yaml
authors: [author_list]
reviewers: [reviewer_list] 
citations: [citation_keys]
validation_sources: [external_sources]
methodology: [research_methodology]
confidence_level: [high|medium|low]
```

#### Database Integration Fields

```yaml
database_refs:
  knowledge_id: [unique_identifier]
  citation_ids: [citation_references]
  related_projects: [project_associations]
```

### Review and Approval Process

#### Content Review Workflow

1. **Creation**: Author creates content with draft status
2. **Self-Review**: Author validates content quality and sources
3. **Peer Review**: External validation where applicable
4. **Publication**: Status updated to published after approval
5. **Maintenance**: Regular review for currency and accuracy

#### Approval Authority

- **Technical Content**: Tool validation through testing
- **Academic Content**: Citation verification and methodology review
- **Structural Changes**: Governance committee approval required
- **Database Schema**: Database administrator approval

### Automation and Maintenance

#### Automated Quality Checks

- YAML frontmatter validation
- Link integrity checking
- Citation format verification
- Database consistency validation
- File organization compliance

#### Continuous Integration

- Pre-commit hooks for quality validation
- Automated testing of code examples
- Documentation site generation
- Database backup automation
- Content lifecycle monitoring

### Compliance and Security

#### Data Management

- Personal data handling in accordance with privacy standards
- Research data management following FAIR principles
- Intellectual property respect and attribution
- License compliance for external content

#### Access Control

- Public content in main documentation
- Sensitive research data in protected databases
- Collaboration guidelines for external contributors
- Version control with proper attribution

## Implementation Guidelines

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Implement governance framework and database schema
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate existing content with YAML frontmatter
3. **Phase 3**: Establish automation and CI/CD workflows
4. **Phase 4**: Train users and establish review processes

### Success Metrics

- 100% YAML frontmatter compliance
- Database integration functional for all knowledge areas
- Automated quality checks passing consistently
- Research lifecycle documentation complete
- User adoption and workflow efficiency

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular governance framework review
- User feedback integration
- Process optimization based on usage patterns
- Technology updates and tool integration
- Academic standard alignment maintenance
