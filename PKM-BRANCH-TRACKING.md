# PKM Organization Style Branch Tracking

This document tracks the different git branches created to demonstrate various Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) organizational styles.

## Branch Overview

| Branch Name | Style | Description | Key Features |
|-------------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `pkm-para-style` | PARA | Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives | Action-oriented organization by lifecycle |
| `pkm-zettelkasten-style` | Zettelkasten | Atomic notes with dense linking | Emergent structure through connections |
| `pkm-johnny-decimal-style` | Johnny Decimal | Numerical hierarchy with stable IDs | Deterministic addressing and reference |
| `pkm-lyt-moc-style` | LYT/MOCs | Maps of Content with fluid structure | Curated entry points and synthesis workbenches |

## Branch Details

### pkm-para-style

**Implementation**: `PKM-PARA-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- **Focus**: Actionability-based organization
- **Structure**: Clear lifecycle management (Projects → Areas → Resources → Archives)
- **Best For**: Project-driven work, operational efficiency
- **Key Benefit**: Reduces "where does this go?" friction

### pkm-zettelkasten-style

**Implementation**: `PKM-ZETTELKASTEN-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- **Focus**: Atomic concepts with networked connections
- **Structure**: Timestamp-based IDs, permanent notes, literature processing
- **Best For**: Research, synthesis, long-term knowledge building
- **Key Benefit**: Emergent insights through connection discovery

### pkm-johnny-decimal-style

**Implementation**: `PKM-JOHNNY-DECIMAL-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- **Focus**: Stable numerical addressing
- **Structure**: 10 Areas, 10 Categories per Area, unique item IDs
- **Best For**: Reference materials, team coordination, stable addressing
- **Key Benefit**: Deterministic location and unambiguous communication

### pkm-lyt-moc-style

**Implementation**: `PKM-LYT-MOC-IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- **Focus**: Flexible structure with curated navigation
- **Structure**: Maps of Content as hubs, fluid categorization
- **Best For**: Creative synthesis, multiple contexts, organic growth
- **Key Benefit**: Combines structure benefits with connection flexibility

## Switching Between Branches

To explore different organizational styles:

```bash
# View all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to specific style
git checkout pkm-para-style
git checkout pkm-zettelkasten-style
git checkout pkm-johnny-decimal-style
git checkout pkm-lyt-moc-style

# Return to main
git checkout main
```

## Implementation Files

Each branch contains a comprehensive implementation guide:

- Philosophical principles
- Directory structure
- Workflow processes
- Sample templates
- Migration strategies
- Tool-specific configurations

## Actor-Critic Evaluation Results

Based on our actor-critic evaluation, the recommended approach for our current system is:

### Pragmatic Hybrid Implementation

1. **Minimal Diátaxis Enhancement**: Add Tutorial/How-To/Explanation/Reference sections to existing MOCs
2. **Simple Relationship Tracking**: Add "Related Concepts" field to YAML frontmatter
3. **Synthesis Hygiene**: Weekly practice of extracting reusable patterns from completed work
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Measure impact and add complexity only if beneficial

### Rationale

- Respects our current successful patterns
- Addresses actual pain points (discovery, synthesis, evolution)
- Avoids over-engineering complexity
- Builds on existing YAML frontmatter and MOC usage
- Sustainable implementation anchored to current workflows

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate**: Review each branch implementation to understand trade-offs
2. **Select**: Choose elements that address our specific needs
3. **Pilot**: Test selected approaches on small subset of content
4. **Measure**: Track improvement in discovery, synthesis, and evolution
5. **Adapt**: Refine based on results and evolving needs

## Branch Maintenance

- **Keep Updated**: Periodically merge main changes to demonstration branches
- **Document Changes**: Update implementation guides as understanding evolves
- **Archive When Needed**: Remove branches that are no longer relevant
- **Create New**: Add branches for emerging PKM methodologies
