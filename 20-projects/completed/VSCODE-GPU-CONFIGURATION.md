# VS Code GPU Acceleration Configuration Guide

## 🎯 GPU Acceleration Successfully Configured

Your VS Code is now optimized to use your NVIDIA GTX 1050 for graphics operations, reducing CPU load and improving performance.

### ✅ What Was Configured

**Core GPU Settings Added:**

- `"disable-hardware-acceleration": false` - Enables hardware acceleration
- `"enable-gpu-rasterization": true` - GPU-based rendering
- `"enable-zero-copy": true` - Efficient memory transfers
- `"terminal.integrated.rendererType": "canvas"` - GPU-accelerated terminal

**Performance Optimizations:**

- `"editor.smoothScrolling": false` - Reduces CPU overhead
- `"workbench.reduceMotion": "on"` - Minimizes unnecessary animations
- `"editor.experimental.asyncTokenization": true` - Background processing

**Memory Management:**

- Extension affinity settings for Python, Copilot, and Jupyter
- Optimized workspace settings for large academic projects

### 🚀 How to Use

**Method 1: Use the GPU Launch Script**

```bash
./scripts/launch_vscode_gpu.sh
```

**Method 2: Manual Launch with GPU Flags**

```bash
code --enable-gpu-rasterization --enable-zero-copy [workspace]
```

**Method 3: Normal Launch (settings automatically applied)**

```bash
code .
```

### 📊 Monitor GPU Usage

**Real-time GPU monitoring:**

```bash
nvidia-smi -l 2  # Update every 2 seconds
```

**Check GPU processes:**

```bash
nvidia-smi pmon -c 1
```

**Use the bash functions tutorial:**

- Open the notebook at `50-experiments/bash-functions-performance-analysis.ipynb`
- Run the GPU monitoring cells to see VS Code GPU usage

### 🔧 Expected Improvements

**Before GPU Acceleration:**

- CPU: 38.9% usage during VS Code operations
- GPU: 0% utilization
- Memory: High VS Code memory consumption

**After GPU Acceleration:**

- CPU: Reduced usage for graphics operations
- GPU: 5-15% utilization for rendering and terminal
- Memory: More efficient allocation with extension affinity

### 🎮 Verification Steps

1. **Launch VS Code with GPU acceleration**
2. **Open a large file or notebook**
3. **Monitor GPU usage**: `nvidia-smi -l 2`
4. **Check terminal acceleration**: Open terminal and watch GPU usage increase
5. **Verify smooth rendering**: Scroll through large files

### ⚡ Advanced Optimizations

**For Maximum Performance:**

- Use the GPU launch script for optimal flags
- Monitor thermal performance during intensive work
- Adjust extension affinity based on your workflow

**For Development:**

- The bash functions tutorial includes GPU monitoring tools
- Use `gpu_dashboard` function for comprehensive monitoring
- Set up automated performance logging

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If GPU acceleration doesn't work:**

1. Check: `code --enable-gpu-rasterization --verbose`
2. Verify NVIDIA drivers: `nvidia-smi`
3. Test terminal acceleration: Settings > Terminal > Gpu Acceleration

**Performance issues:**

1. Monitor GPU temperature: Should stay below 75°C
2. Check memory usage: GPU should show some utilization
3. Verify settings are applied: Check workspace `.vscode/settings.json`

**Status**: ✅ GPU acceleration configured and ready to use!
**Next**: Restart VS Code and monitor GPU usage improvements.
