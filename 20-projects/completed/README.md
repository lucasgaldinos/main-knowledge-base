# Projects

Project documentation, case studies, and specific implementation records.

## Contents

This section contains documentation for specific projects, their outcomes, and lessons learned.

## Current Projects

- [AI Agent Toolsets Implementation Completion Report](<./ai-agent-toolsets-implementation-completion-report.md>) - Comprehensive AI agent configuration with VS Code Copilot and MCP integration
- [Academic Research Platform System Design](<./academic-research-platform-system-design.md>)
- [ArXiv MCP Enhanced Design](<./arxiv-mcp-enhanced-design.md>)

- [Copilot PDF Processing Workflow Design](<../../../../copilot-pdf-processing-workflow-design-202508271745.md>)

## Project Documentation Structure

Each project should include:

- **Project Overview** - Goals, scope, and context
- **Implementation Details** - Technical specifications and architecture
- **Results and Outcomes** - What was achieved and learned
- **Lessons Learned** - Insights for future projects
- **References and Dependencies** - Related materials and external resources

## Organization

Projects are organized chronologically and by domain. Completed projects serve as case studies and reference implementations for future work.
