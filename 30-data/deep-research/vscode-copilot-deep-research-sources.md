# VS Code GitHub Copilot Deep Research Sources

## Research Query

VS Code GitHub Copilot comprehensive documentation guide: instructions configuration, prompt engineering best practices, agent toolsets integration, MCP configurations and servers, VS Code Copilot Chat features, inline suggestions optimization, workspace integration patterns, academic writing workflows

## Research Parameters

- **Depth**: 4 (comprehensive analysis)
- **Breadth**: 4 (wide coverage)
- **Token Budget**: 45,000
- **Source Preferences**: Focus on official Microsoft VS Code documentation, GitHub Copilot official guides, practical implementation examples, avoid general AI content

## Key Findings Summary

### 1. Installation and Configuration

- VS Code ≥1.86 required for Inline Chat APIs
- Essential extensions: GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot Chat, language-specific LSPs
- Critical settings for optimization: inline suggestions, acceptance behavior, language-specific enablement

### 2. Chat Features and Agents

- Built-in agents: @workspace, @vscode, @terminal, @github
- Extension-provided agents vary by installed Copilot Extensions
- Slash commands: /explain, /fix, /tests, /doc, /optimize, /refactor

### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

- Structure: Intent → Scope → Artifacts → Guardrails
- Use selections and few-shot examples for better accuracy
- Decompose complex tasks into Plan → Implement → Verify phases

### 4. Workspace Integration

- Repository-level instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- Documentation as model context (README, ARCHITECTURE, etc.)
- Testing-first patterns with TDD integration

### 5. MCP Integration Pathways

- GitHub Copilot Chat does not natively support arbitrary MCP servers
- Use MCP-capable extensions (Continue, Cline) alongside Copilot
- Custom MCP server development with TypeScript/Node.js or Python SDKs

### 6. Academic Writing Workflows

- Environment setup with Markdown, LaTeX, Quarto, and citation management
- Evidence discipline: request scaffolding only, verify citations manually
- Section-level workflows for methods, results, and related work

### 7. Security and Governance

- IP management and code provenance considerations
- Review culture treating AI edits like junior contributor PRs
- Metrics tracking for quality assurance

## High-Confidence Findings

- VS Code configuration and settings optimization
- Copilot Chat features and agent capabilities
- Prompt engineering techniques and patterns
- Workspace integration best practices

## Medium-Confidence Findings

- MCP integration specifics (evolving ecosystem)
- Repository-level instructions (feature availability varies)
- Extension ecosystem capabilities (version-dependent)
