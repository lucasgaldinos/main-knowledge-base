# Sources for System Design and Architecture Research

## Reliability of Claims and Evidence Considerations

- Much of the guidance on patterns/styles is triangulated from decades of practice and classic literature (e.g., GoF patterns, POSA series, DDD, SRE/DevOps practices, cloud design patterns). Empirical support includes widely reported outcomes around DORA metrics correlating with organizational performance and incident postmortem cultures improving MTTR.
- Areas of ongoing debate: Microservices ROI for small teams; the operational tax of service meshes; GraphQLâ€™s net complexity versus benefits; event sourcing payoff versus maintenance cost. Recommendations here prioritize minimal complexity and incremental adoption with fitness functions.
- Distributed systems trade-offs (CAP/PACELC, fallacies) are well-established. Exact implementation choices (e.g., which NewSQL database, which mesh) should be validated with context-specific benchmarks and failure tests.
