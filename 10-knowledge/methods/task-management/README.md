# Task Management

This directory previously contained task management files that have been moved for better accessibility.

## Relocated Files

- **TASKS.md** → **Moved to root level** (`/TASKS.md`) for immediate access
- **TODO.md** → **Moved to root level** (`/TODO.md`) for immediate access

**Rationale**: Task management files are operational and need frequent access. Moving them to root level eliminates deep hierarchy navigation and improves daily workflow efficiency.

## Current Contents

This directory now serves as documentation for task management methodologies and processes.

## Purpose

Centralizes task management documentation to support systematic project execution and progress tracking.
