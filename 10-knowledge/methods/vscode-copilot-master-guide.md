        r'password\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']',
        r'api_key\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']',
        r'secret\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']'
    ]
    
    redacted = code_context
    for pattern in patterns:
        redacted = re.sub(pattern, 'password="[REDACTED]"', redacted)
    
    return redacted
```

---

## 8. Troubleshooting and Optimization

### 8.1 Common Configuration Issues

#### Toolset Functionality Problems

**Symptom**: Workspace-level toolsets not working consistently
**Root Causes** (Based on real resolution):
- Empty markdown files causing Git reference errors
- Configuration precedence conflicts
- Missing file content causing VS Code parsing issues

**Resolution Steps**:
1. **Audit Empty Files**
   ```bash
   find . -name "*.md" -size 0 -ls
   ```

2. **Populate Empty Files**
   ```bash
   # Create minimal valid content
   echo "# Placeholder" > empty-file.md
   ```

3. **Validate Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git fsck --full
   git gc --aggressive
   ```

#### Performance Optimization

**Context Window Management**:
- Limit open files to relevant context
- Use specific file selections rather than workspace-wide searches
- Implement context pruning for large codebases

**Response Time Optimization**:
```json
{
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "length": 2000,
    "inlineSuggestCount": 2,
    "temperature": 0.1
  }
}
```

### 8.2 MCP Server Debugging

#### Connection Issues
```bash
# Test MCP server connectivity
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/health
```

#### Logging Configuration
```python
import logging

# MCP server debug logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('mcp-server.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

### 8.3 Academic Workflow Optimization

#### Research Efficiency Patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar research tasks
- **Template Reuse**: Standardize common analysis patterns
- **Result Caching**: Store intermediate results for reuse
- **Incremental Updates**: Regular small improvements vs large refactors

#### Citation and Reference Management
```python
def validate_citations(document: str) -> List[str]:
    """Validate academic citations in document"""
    citation_pattern = r'\[@\w+\d{4}\w*\]'
    citations = re.findall(citation_pattern, document)
    
    missing_refs = []
    for citation in citations:
        if not validate_bibliography_entry(citation):
            missing_refs.append(citation)
    
    return missing_refs
```
