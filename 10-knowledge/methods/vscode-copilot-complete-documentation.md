## 2. Copilot Chat in VS Code: Features and Practical Usage

### 2.1 Views and Modes

**Chat View:**

- Dedicated panel for multi-turn conversations
- Supports file attachments, code selections, and terminal output
- Integrated with agents and slash commands

**Inline Chat:**

- Transient, file-localized chat overlay
- Proposes code edits, refactors, or fixes directly in the current buffer
- Provides diff review and application workflow

**Edits and Diff Application:**

- Review and apply proposed changes
- Multi-file change management
- Version control integration

### 2.2 Available Agents

**Built-in Agents:**

- `@workspace`: Ask questions about the current workspace (files, symbols)
- `@vscode`: Run VS Code commands, open files, create snippets
- `@terminal`: Suggest and run command lines with approval
- `@github`: Interact with GitHub repositories and issues (if available)

**Extension-Provided Agents:**

- Installing Docker, Azure, Postman, or other Copilot Extensions adds domain-specific agents
- Examples: `@docker`, `@azure`, `@postman`, `@sentry`
- Capabilities vary by extension version and authentication status

### 2.3 Slash Commands

**Common Slash Commands:**

- `/explain`: Explain selected code or error messages
- `/fix`: Propose fixes for current diagnostics or test failures
- `/tests`: Generate tests for selected functions or files
- `/doc`: Draft documentation or comments
- `/optimize`: Performance or style improvements
- `/refactor`: Code structure improvements

**Best Practices:**

- Pair slash commands with explicit constraints (language, framework, coding standards)
- Attach relevant files and code selections for better context
- Specify desired output format (diff, new file, explanation)

### 2.4 Context Control and Quality

**Effective Context Management:**

- Provide minimal, most relevant code selections
- Use "Add Context" to attach additional files or logs
- Include failing test output and error messages
- Leverage workspace symbols and language server indices

**Improving Context Quality:**

- Maintain current README, ARCHITECTURE.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md files
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add meaningful comments and docstrings
- Organize code with clear module boundaries

## 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 3.1 Structure Prompts for Determinism

**Effective Prompt Structure:**

1. **Intent**: One-sentence objective
   - Example: "Refactor parseConfig to be pure and add schema validation"
2. **Scope**: Specific files, functions, and constraints
   - Example: "Only modify src/config.ts, maintain public API, use Zod for validation"
3. **Artifacts**: Request concrete outputs
   - Example: "Provide a diff showing the changes and updated test cases"
4. **Guardrails**: Specify limitations and requirements
   - Example: "No external dependencies, preserve backward compatibility"

### 3.2 Use Selections and Few-Shot Examples

**Selection-Based Prompts:**

- Highlight the specific function or code block before prompting
- Selections act as ground truth and reduce hallucinations
- Provide small input/output examples to anchor behavior

**Style Consistency:**

- Paste a short exemplar (docstring pattern, logging format)
- Request: "Match this style and maintain consistency"
- Use existing codebase patterns as templates

### 3.3 Decompose Complex Tasks

**Three-Phase Approach:**

1. **Plan**: Ask for a stepwise plan first
2. **Implement**: Confirm the plan, then request diffs
3. **Verify**: Ask for test suggestions or acceptance checklist

**Risk Management:**

- For risky changes, request an "acceptance checklist"
- Break large changes into smaller, reviewable chunks
- Validate each step before proceeding

### 3.4 Language-Aware Constraints

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**

- Demand type-accurate changes and successful compilation
- Request specific ESLint/Prettier compliance
- Ask for runtime error handling

**Python:**

- Insist on pinned dependencies and exact import paths
- Request pytest-compatible test names and structure
- Include performance constraints when relevant

**Academic Writing:**

- Request specific citation formats (APA, IEEE, etc.)
- Maintain academic tone and modality
- Hedge claims appropriately

### 3.5 Reliable Output Formatting

**Structured Outputs:**

- Request JSON arrays for test cases or data structures
- Ensure code remains in fenced blocks
- Specify diff format for file modifications
- Request file paths and line numbers for large changes

## 4. Optimizing Inline Suggestions

### 4.1 Improving Completion Quality

**High-Signal Comments:**

- Precede functions with concise, imperative comments
- Describe intended behavior and constraints
- Use consistent comment patterns across the codebase

**Type Information:**

- Add comprehensive type annotations (Python, TypeScript)
- Maintain up-to-date docstrings
- Use meaningful variable and function names

**File Headers:**

- Include consistent license headers
- Document module purpose and invariants
- Maintain clear import organization

### 4.2 Editor Configuration

**Acceptance Settings:**

```json
{
  "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off",
  "editor.inlineSuggest.showToolbar": "onHover",
  "editor.tabCompletion": "on"
}
```

**Partial Acceptance Keybindings:**

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+right",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextWord",
  "when": "inlineSuggestionVisible"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+down",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine",
  "when": "inlineSuggestionVisible"
}
```

### 4.3 Context-Specific Optimization

**Language-Specific Settings:**

```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "markdown": true,
    "plaintext": false,
    "yaml": true,
    "json": true,
    "log": false
  }
}
```

**Manual Trigger Strategy:**

- Use manual trigger in novel codepaths
- Rely on autosuggest for routine patterns
- Combine with Inline Chat for complex edits

## 7. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

### 7.1 MCP Concepts and Architecture

**What is MCP:**

- Standardizes communication between LLM clients and external tools
- Enables auditable tool boundaries and multi-provider compatibility
- Supports tools (functions), resources (documents), and prompts

**Benefits:**

- Composable tool ecosystems
- Provider-agnostic integrations
- Standardized security boundaries

### 7.2 MCP in VS Code

**Current State:**

- GitHub Copilot Chat does not natively support arbitrary MCP server registration
- Use MCP-capable client extensions (Continue, Cline) alongside Copilot
- Configure MCP servers through client extension settings

**Example Configuration (Continue):**

```json
{
  "continue.mcpServers": [
    {
      "id": "filesystem",
      "displayName": "Read-only Filesystem",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOWED_DIRS": "/workspace/src,/workspace/docs"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "git",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7.3 Writing Custom MCP Servers

**TypeScript/Node.js Example:**

```typescript
import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js';
import { z } from 'zod';

const server = new Server({
  name: 'knowledge-base',
  version: '1.0.0'
});

server.addTool({
  name: 'search_notes',
  description: 'Search through knowledge base notes',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
    limit: z.number().optional()
  }),
  handler: async (args) => {
    // Implementation
    return { results: [] };
  }
});

await server.listen();
```

**Python Example:**

```python
from mcp import Server
from typing import List

srv = Server(name="notes-server")

@srv.tool()
def search_notes(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[str]:
    """Search through knowledge base notes"""
    # Implementation
    return []

@srv.resource(path="/notes/{slug}")
def get_note(slug: str) -> str:
    """Retrieve a specific note by slug"""
    # Implementation
    return ""

if __name__ == "__main__":
    srv.run()
```

### 7.4 Security and Best Practices

**Security Guidelines:**

- Prefer read-only servers for sensitive operations
- Scope server access to specific workspace directories
- Avoid giving shell/network access unless properly sandboxed
