# Contributing to the Knowledge Base

This document outlines the processes and guidelines for contributing to the knowledge base.

## Organization Principles

Our knowledge base follows a **function-based organization** approach with the following structure:

- `docs/foundations/` - Core concepts and foundational knowledge
- `docs/guides/` - How-to guides and tutorials
- `docs/reference/` - Reference materials and quick lookups
- `docs/projects/` - Project documentation and case studies
- `docs/processes/` - Workflows and procedures
- `docs/research/` - Research content and academic materials
- `docs/tools/` - Tool documentation and configurations

## Content Guidelines

### File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `my-document-name.md`
- Be descriptive and specific
- Include dates for time-sensitive content: `project-report-20250910.md`

### Document Structure

Each document should include:

- Clear title and purpose
- Table of contents for longer documents
- Consistent heading structure
- Links to related materials
- Last updated date

### Markdown Standards

- Use proper heading hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Include alt text for images
- Use relative links for internal references
- Follow standard markdown formatting

## Content Lifecycle

### 1. Draft Phase

- Create content in appropriate directory
- Use `[DRAFT]` prefix in title
- Include completion status

### 2. Review Phase

- Remove `[DRAFT]` prefix
- Ensure proper categorization
- Verify links and references
- Check formatting and style

### 3. Published

- Content is complete and reviewed
- Properly linked from relevant README files
- Included in navigation structure

### 4. Maintenance

- Regular review for accuracy
- Update links and references
- Archive outdated content

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy

- Verify all technical information
- Test procedures and instructions
- Include sources for external information

### Clarity

- Write for the intended audience
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful

### Completeness

- Cover the topic thoroughly
- Include prerequisites and assumptions
- Provide troubleshooting guidance

## Automation

The knowledge base includes automation scripts for:

- Link checking
- Format validation
- Content organization
- Index generation

These are located in `.github/workflows/` and should be maintained alongside content changes.

## Getting Help

- Check existing documentation first
- Look for similar content in related sections
- Follow the established patterns and structures
- Ask for guidance when unsure about organization
