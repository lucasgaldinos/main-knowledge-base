2. **Maintain Quality**: Run validation scripts in `.kb/scripts/`
3. **Monitor Health**: Use enhanced maintenance tool in `40-code/`
4. **Follow Best Practices**: Reference user guide in `00-admin/`
5. **Troubleshoot Issues**: Use comprehensive documentation

## üìö Key Resources for Users

- **Quick Start**: `00-admin/user-guide.md`
- **Templates**: `.kb/templates/` directory
- **Validation**: `python3 .kb/scripts/validate_structure.py`
- **Maintenance**: `python3 40-code/maintain_kb_enhanced.py --scan`
- **Governance**: `.kb/policy/kb-policy.yaml`

## üîÑ Ongoing Maintenance Tasks

### Daily
- Use templates for new content creation
- Run validation before commits

### Weekly  
- Execute enhanced maintenance scan
- Review and address any issues found

### Monthly
- Archive completed projects over 1 year old
