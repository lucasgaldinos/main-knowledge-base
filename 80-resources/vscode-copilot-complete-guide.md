## Mental Model and Context Understanding

### Context Channels

GitHub Copilot in VS Code operates through multiple context channels:

- **Editor Context**: Selected code, open files, symbols/references
- **Workspace Index**: Codebase graph, build files, README, CONTRIBUTING
- **Chat Participants**: VS Code agents and slash-commands (use `/help` to discover)
- **External Systems**: Git data, terminal output, test results, partner extensions

### Interaction Modes

#### Inline Chat/Edits

- **Purpose**: Localized code changes with live diffs
- **Best For**: Small, precise edits or refactors within current buffer
- **Usage**: Select code → Ask for specific changes → Review diff → Apply

#### Chat Panel/Long-form

- **Purpose**: Multi-file changes, design reasoning, exploration
- **Best For**: Complex refactoring, feature planning, cross-repo analysis
- **Usage**: Attach explicit files/snippets to reduce ambiguity

### Agent Toolset Philosophy

- **Start Minimal**: Each tool should have clear purpose and auditability
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Require confirmation for destructive operations
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain ability to revert changes

## Custom Instructions Best Practices

### Universal Prompt Structure

```markdown
# Core Behavioral Contract

## Context and Role
- Act as [specific role] for this [project type]
- Objective: [clear goal] while preserving [constraints]

## Standards and Constraints
- Follow [STYLEGUIDE.md, coding standards]
- Security: [input validation, no secrets in logs]
- Performance: [complexity targets, optimization guidelines]

## Workflow Requirements
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements
- List assumptions before proposing changes
- Provide plan before multi-file edits (>2 files)
- Include tests for all new/changed logic
- Reference exact files/paths used
```

### Repository-Wide Instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)

```markdown
---
# Project Context
This is a [description] following [architecture/framework].

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code organized by [pattern]
- `tests/`: Test files mirroring src structure
- `docs/`: Documentation following [standard]
- `config/`: Configuration files for [environments]

## Coding Standards
- Language: [TypeScript/Python/etc.] with [specific version]
- Style: Follow [ESLint/Black/etc.] configurations
- Testing: [Jest/pytest/etc.] with [coverage requirements]
- Documentation: [JSDoc/docstrings] for all public APIs

## Security Requirements
- Input validation for all user data
- No secrets in code or logs
- Use [specific security libraries/patterns]

## AI Assistance Guidelines
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requirements
- Never invent APIs - search workspace first
- Propose tests for all code changes
- Plan multi-file changes before implementing
- Reference specific files and line numbers
---
```

### Path-Specific Instructions (.instructions.md)

```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/components/**/*.tsx"
---

# React Component Guidelines

## Architecture
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React 18+ patterns
- No legacy class components

## State Management
- Use Zustand for global state
- Local state with useState/useReducer
- Avoid prop drilling

## Styling
- Tailwind CSS with design tokens
- CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Follow design system patterns

## Testing
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Mock external dependencies
- Test user interactions, not implementation
```

### Language-Specific Overlays

```markdown
# TypeScript/React Guidelines
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use strict TypeScript configurations
- Interface definitions for all data structures
- Optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??)
- React.FC types for components with children

# Python Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 with Black formatting
- Type hints for all function signatures
- Docstrings following Google style
- Use dataclasses for structured data
- Prefer pathlib over os.path
```

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### Reusable Instruction Patterns

#### Refactor (Single File)

```
Refactor the selected function to eliminate duplicate logic and make error handling explicit. 
Maintain exact behavior. Add unit tests to file X covering success, common failure, and edge cases. 
Show a diff and explain trade-offs.
```

#### Multi-File Feature Plan

```
Goal: [specific feature description]
Context: [attach relevant files]
Propose a 3-step plan with:
- Specific file changes needed
- Acceptance criteria
- Test strategy
Ask me to confirm before making edits.
```

#### Security Fix

```
Given the attached [vulnerability type] report, identify vulnerable code paths. 
Propose the minimal fix using [specific library/pattern]. 
Add regression tests and list similar sites to inspect.
```

#### Performance Optimization

```
Analyze the attached [performance data] for function X. 
Suggest minimally invasive optimizations with:
- Estimated complexity and memory deltas
- Micro-benchmark harness
- Risk assessment
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Ambiguous Prompts**: "Make this better" without specific goals
- **Overloading**: Multiple unrelated tasks in single request
- **Blind Copy-Paste**: Large files without scoping to relevant sections
- **Bulk Accept**: Accepting edits without tests or performance checks

## Agent Toolset Configuration

### VS Code Settings Configuration

```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true
  },
  "github.copilot.chat.customInstructions": "See docs/ai/copilot-instructions.md for full policy. Key rules: ask clarifying questions; never invent APIs; follow STYLEGUIDE.md; propose tests; plan before multi-file edits.",
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true
  },
  "security.workspace.trust.enabled": true,
  "testing.autoRun.mode": "queued"
}
```

### Extension Ecosystem

#### Core Extensions

- **GitHub Copilot**: Primary AI assistance
- **GitHub Copilot Chat**: Conversational interface
- **GitLens**: Enhanced Git integration
- **Thunder Client**: API testing
- **Error Lens**: Inline error display

#### Language-Specific

- **TypeScript**: Enhanced language server
- **Python**: Pylance language server
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting

### Tool Curation Strategy

```markdown
# Tool Catalog Standards

## Allowed Extensions
- Core: GitHub Copilot, Copilot Chat, GitLens
- Language: Pylance, TypeScript, Rust-analyzer
- Testing: Test Explorer, Coverage Gutters
- Security: Snyk, SonarLint

## Required Settings
- Human approval for destructive operations
- Logging enabled for audit trails
- Minimal permissions principle

## Approval Workflows
1. Plan → Human Review → Implementation
2. Staged rollout with monitoring
3. Rollback procedures documented
```

## MCP Integration Workflows

### MCP Server Configuration

Note: GitHub Copilot doesn't natively support MCP. Use MCP-compatible extensions like "Claude for VS Code" alongside Copilot.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_FS_ROOTS": "${workspaceFolder}"
      },
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    },
    "shell": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-shell"],
      "env": {
        "ALLOW_COMMANDS": "npm,yarn,pytest,make,cargo"
      },
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Configuration

```markdown
# MCP Security Standards

## Filesystem Access
- Restrict to workspace folder only
- Never mount $HOME by default
- Audit file operations

## Shell Commands
- Allowlist approved commands only
- Environment variable restrictions
- Command logging required

## Network Access
- API calls through documented contracts only
- No direct HTTP without approval
- Rate limiting and monitoring
```

### Separation of Duties

```markdown
# Copilot vs MCP Agent Responsibilities

## GitHub Copilot
- Code edits and refactoring
- Inline suggestions
- Workspace reasoning
- Quick documentation

## MCP Agent (Claude/Continue)
- Tool-driven tasks (run tests, query APIs)
- File system operations with audit
- External service integration
- Governed data access
```
