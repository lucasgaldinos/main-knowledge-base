## Introduction to MCP Servers

### What are MCP Servers?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are standards-based tool interfaces that expose enterprise capabilities (CRUD APIs, search/retrieval, actions, knowledge resources) to AI agents via a uniform protocol. They serve as policy-aware adapters that present resources and tools to agents while maintaining security boundaries and governance controls.

### Key Characteristics

- **Policy-Aware Integration**: Built-in governance and security controls
- **Standardized Interface**: Uniform protocol for agent-tool interactions
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Designed for production environments with compliance requirements
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multi-agent orchestration and high-throughput scenarios

### Enterprise Value Proposition

1. **Unified Tool Ecosystem**: Consistent interface across diverse enterprise systems
2. **Security by Design**: Built-in authentication, authorization, and audit trails
3. **Governance Integration**: Policy enforcement and compliance alignment
4. **Operational Excellence**: Observability, monitoring, and reliability patterns

## Enterprise Architecture Patterns

### 1. Two-Plane Architecture (Recommended Baseline)

The foundation of enterprise MCP deployment separates concerns into control and data planes:

#### Control Plane (Security/Governance)

- **Identity and Access Management**: OIDC/OAuth2, SAML, SCIM integration
- **Policy Decision/Enforcement**: Central PDP (OPA/Rego or Cedar) with distributed PEPs
- **Catalog & Registry**: MCP server registry with versioning and capability schemas
- **Approvals & Change Management**: Workflow for onboarding and high-risk actions
- **Observability & Compliance**: Centralized logging, tracing, and audit capabilities

#### Data Plane (Execution)

- **MCP Servers**: Domain-aligned servers wrapping underlying APIs/databases
- **Agent Execution Sandboxes**: Per-task ephemeral environments with egress policies
- **Memory/RAG Stores**: Vector databases and knowledge graphs with tenancy isolation
- **Message Bus/Event Stream**: Agent coordination infrastructure with topic-level ACLs

### 2. MCP Gateway Pattern

A critical mediation layer that serves as the front door for all MCP traffic:

**Core Functions:**

- Authentication (mutual TLS, JWT/OIDC, workload identity)
- Authorization by scope and attribute mapping
- Egress & Data Loss Controls (URL allowlists, SSRF protections, PII detection)
- Rate Limiting and Quota enforcement
- Policy injection with tamper-resistant constraints
- Comprehensive audit fan-out

**Implementation Considerations:**

```yaml
# Example Gateway Configuration
gateway:
  authentication:
    method: "mTLS + JWT"
    workload_identity: "SPIFFE"
  authorization:
    policy_engine: "OPA"
    decision_cache_ttl: "5m"
  rate_limiting:
    per_principal: "1000/hour"
    per_tool: "100/hour"
    adaptive_surge: true
  egress_control:
    url_allowlist: ["api.company.com", "data.warehouse.internal"]
    content_inspection: true
    pii_detection: true
```

### 3. Domain-Aligned MCP Servers

Organize MCP servers by business domain for clear ownership and bounded contexts:

**Benefits:**

- Clear ownership and accountability
- Domain schema evolution independence
- Scoped blast radius for changes
- Predictable change windows

**Design Principles:**

- One MCP server per domain team
- Cohesive resources and tools within domain
- Least-privilege service accounts
- Built-in input/output validation

### 4. MCP Broker/Aggregator Pattern

For complex scenarios requiring cross-system orchestration:

**Use Cases:**

- Customer 360 queries hitting CRM + billing + support
- Multi-system transaction coordination
- Schema harmonization across backends

**Capabilities:**

- Sub-call orchestration with result merging
- Cross-system policy enforcement
- Caching with differential privacy
- Standardized error semantics

## Security Framework

### Threat Model for Enterprise MCP

**Primary Threat Categories:**

1. **Indirect Prompt Injection**: Malicious instructions in documents/emails influencing agent behavior
2. **Tool Scope Exploitation**: Privilege escalation through overbroad permissions
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Via outbound tools, storage writes, or error channels
4. **Code/Command Execution**: RCE vectors through shell, SQL, or code execution tools
5. **Supply Chain Risk**: Malicious or compromised MCP servers and dependencies
6. **Multi-Agent Emergent Risks**: Collusion, infinite loops, unsafe consensus

### Defense-in-Depth Strategy

#### 1. Identity and Authorization

```yaml
identity_framework:
  workload_identity: "SPIFFE/SPIRE"
  token_lifetime: "5-15 minutes"
  access_control: "ABAC/ReBAC"
  policy_storage: "Git with signed releases"
  continuous_reauth: "sensitive_actions"
```

#### 2. Tool-Level Security

- **Explicit Allowlists**: Per agent role and task type
- **Input/Output Schemas**: JSON Schema validation with rejection policies
- **TEE/Confidential Compute**: For high-sensitivity workloads
- **Execution Sandboxing**: Per-invocation ephemeral containers

#### 3. Content Safety and Injection Resistance

- **Boundary Normalization**: Strip HTML/JS, enforce markdown/plaintext
- **Context Segment Separation**: Cryptographically signed system prompts
- **Injection Detection**: Heuristic and model-based detectors
- **Safety Critics**: Independent safety evaluation agents

#### 4. Secrets and Key Management

```yaml
secrets_management:
  provider: "HashiCorp Vault"
  credential_type: "dynamic"
  rotation_frequency: "hourly"
  scope: "per_tool"
  encryption: "envelope_encryption_with_tenant_deks"
```

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Core Orchestration Patterns

#### 1. Coordinator-Workers (Hierarchical)

- **Structure**: Central planner with specialized worker agents
- **Use Cases**: Complex task decomposition and execution
- **Controls**: Planner limiters, tool scopes, independent reviewers

#### 2. Blackboard/Stigmergic Collaboration

- **Structure**: Shared state with role-based read/write permissions
- **Use Cases**: Investigative workflows, collaborative analysis
- **Controls**: Schema-typed slots, moderation services, conflict resolution

#### 3. Contract Net/Market-Based Allocation

- **Structure**: Agents bid for tasks based on capability/cost
- **Use Cases**: Resource optimization, variable tool costs
- **Controls**: Audit trails, randomized tie-breaks, periodic rebidding

#### 4. Critic/Referee and Debate Patterns

- **Structure**: Independent evaluation and multi-agent consensus
- **Use Cases**: High-stakes decisions, quality assurance
- **Controls**: Distinct safety policies, confidence thresholds

### Safety-First Autonomy Framework

```yaml
autonomy_controls:
  sandbox_budgets:
    max_cost: "$50"
    max_duration: "30 minutes"
    max_tool_calls: "100"
  boundary_controls:
    human_in_loop: "external_writes"
    approval_required: "financial_transactions"
    escalation_threshold: "confidence < 0.8"
  monitoring:
    loop_detection: true
    resource_monitoring: true
    anomaly_detection: true
```

- **23894**: AI Risk Management
- **42001**: AI Management Systems

### Policy-as-Code Framework

```yaml
policy_framework:
  storage: "Git repository"
  language: "OPA Rego / Cedar"
  versioning: "Semantic versioning"
  deployment: "GitOps with signed releases"
  validation: "CI/CD policy tests"
  enforcement: "Distributed PEPs"
```

### Data Governance Architecture

#### Classification and Zoning
