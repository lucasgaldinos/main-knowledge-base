## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-10

### ðŸŽ‰ **Major Release: Academic Research Structure Implementation**

#### Added

- **Academic Directory Structure**: Complete reorganization following Tree of Thought 3 (Academic Research Focus)
  - `knowledge/` - Academic knowledge repository with foundations, methods, applications, synthesis
  - `projects/` - Project lifecycle management (active, completed, archived)
  - `resources/` - Supporting materials (literature, tools, data)
  - `infrastructure/` - Scripts, automation, and maintenance tools
  - `outputs/` - Generated content and publications

- **Database Integration**: SQLite-based persistent storage system
  - `knowledge.db` - Knowledge articles and documentation
  - `citations.db` - Academic citations and references
  - `analytics.db` - Usage analytics and metrics
  - `workflows.db` - Process documentation and workflows

- **Governance Framework**:
  - `GOVERNANCE.md` - Academic research governance with quality standards
  - `CITATION.cff` - Academic citation metadata
  - YAML frontmatter enforcement for all documentation

- **Automation Tools**:
  - YAML frontmatter enforcer with intelligent content analysis
  - Database setup and management scripts
  - Organization maintenance scripts

- **Content Migration**:
  - Complete migration from legacy `docs/` structure to academic organization
  - 41 files automatically standardized with YAML frontmatter
  - Preservation of all existing documentation

#### Changed

- **Directory Structure**: Migrated from flat `docs/` structure to hierarchical academic organization
- **Metadata Standards**: Implemented consistent YAML frontmatter across all markdown files
- **Tool References**: Updated comprehensive-tools-reference.md with enhanced categorization
- **Project Management**: Reorganized project files with completion status tracking

#### Removed

- Legacy `docs/` directory structure
- Inconsistent file organization patterns
- Missing metadata from documentation files

#### Infrastructure

- **Scripts Location**: Moved to `infrastructure/scripts/` for centralized automation
- **Database Setup**: Automated database initialization with comprehensive schema
- **Quality Assurance**: YAML frontmatter validation and enforcement
- **Academic Standards**: Citation and governance framework implementation

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

#### Database Schema

```sql
-- Knowledge Management
knowledge_articles: id, title, category, status, content_hash, created_at, updated_at
citations: id, title, authors, year, source_type, url, accessed_date
analytics: id, tool_name, usage_count, last_used, category
workflows: id, name, description, steps, tools_used, created_at
```

#### YAML Frontmatter Template

```yaml

title: [Descriptive Title]
description: [Brief description]
status: [draft|active|completed|archived]
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
tags: [relevant, tags, list]
version: [X.Y.Z]
