- JavaScript testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Playwright)
- Model Context Protocol servers and orchestration

## Implementation Philosophy

Our guides follow these core principles:

1. **Research-Driven**: Based on comprehensive analysis of current best practices and emerging trends
2. **Practical Focus**: Include working code examples, real scenarios, and production-ready patterns
3. **Enterprise-Ready**: Designed for professional environments with security, governance, and scalability considerations
4. **Tool Integration**: Deep integration with VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and modern development workflows
5. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing, validation, and continuous improvement processes

## Quick Start Paths

### For Documentation Excellence

1. Review [Documentation Best Practices](./documentation-best-practices.md)
2. Choose your framework (Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus)
3. Implement docs-as-code workflows
4. Set up automated quality gates

### For Testing Excellence  

1. Review [Testing Comprehensive Guide](./testing-comprehensive-guide.md)
2. Set up your testing framework (pytest for Python, Jest/Vitest for JavaScript)
3. Configure VS Code testing integration
4. Implement CI/CD testing pipelines

### For Advanced Integration

1. Review [MCP Integration Workflows](./mcp-integration-workflows.md)
2. Set up MCP servers and orchestration
3. Implement research and documentation automation
4. Create custom workflow patterns

## Contributing to Guides

When creating new implementation guides:

1. **Research Foundation**: Use our deep research methodology with 50k+ token analysis
2. **Structure**: Follow established patterns with comprehensive sections and examples
3. **Practical Examples**: Include complete, tested code examples and real-world scenarios
4. **Integration Focus**: Show how technologies work together in modern development workflows
5. **Quality Validation**: Include testing strategies and validation approaches
6. **Documentation**: Follow our documentation best practices for consistency
