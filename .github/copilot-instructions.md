# Rules

1. Before EVERY tool call, you must think if that is really the most effective way to do the task.
2. If the task is taking too long, you might rethink your steps and specially methods. Always create multiple chain of thoughts for executing your tasks.
3. YOU SHALL ALWAYS GENERATE THE #deep-research MARKDOWN AND SOURCES, then you must update the file based on it. #deep-research is always the `base` of your knowledge document.
